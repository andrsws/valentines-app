- Make sure you followed all steps in the installation guide
- Try restarting Safari and trying again

### "The app looks wrong"
- Make sure you're using the latest iOS version
- Try clearing Safari cache: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
- Reload the page

### "The photos won't load"
- Make sure you have an internet connection
- Give it a few seconds to load

## Privacy & Security 🔒

### Is my data safe?
Yes! This app:
- ✅ Runs entirely on your device
- ✅ Doesn't send any data to servers
- ✅ Doesn't track you
- ✅ Doesn't collect any information
- ✅ Works offline

### Can others see my letters?
The content is embedded in the app code, so technically yes if they have the link. But:
- The URL can be private
- Your device cache is private
- Once installed, it's just for you
